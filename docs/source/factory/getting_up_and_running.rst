Getting it up and running
=========================

ServiceCatalog-Factory runs in your AWS Account.  In order for you to install it into your account you can use the 
aws-service-catalog-factory cli.  This is distributed via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aws-service-catalog-factory/)

What am I going to install?
---------------------------
---------------------------
ServiceCatalog-Factory is bootstrapped from your local machine.  You install a command line utility that will provision
the resources you need into your AWS Account.  Once you have completed the bootstrap you will have the following pipeline
in your account:


.. image:: ./factory-getting-started-what-am-i-going-to-install-pipeline.png

using the following services:

.. image:: ./factory-getting-started-what-am-i-going-to-install.png



Before you install
------------------
You should consider which account will be the home for your factory.  This account will contain the AWS CodePipelines
and will need to be accessible to any accounts you would like to share with.
 

Installing the tool
-------------------
This is a python cli built using Python 3.

It is good practice to install Python libraries in isolated environments.  You can create the a virtual environment using
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv
    source venv/bin/activate


Once you have decided where to install the library you can install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install aws-service-catalog-factory


This will install the library and all of the dependencies.


Setting it up
-------------
The Factory will run in your account and needs some configuration.  You will need to stand up the factory and set up the 
configuration for it to run smoothly.


Bootstrapping the Factory
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are two parts to bootstrapping the factory.  The first is concerned with setting the global configurations.  To do 
this we use AWS SSM Parameters.  To get setup you need to create a configuration file with a list of regions you want to 
use - for example config.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

    regions: [
      'us-east-2',
      'us-east-1',
      'us-west-1',
      'us-west-2',
      'ap-south-1',
      'ap-northeast-2',
      'ap-southeast-1',
      'ap-southeast-2',
      'ap-northeast-1',
      'ca-central-1',
      'eu-central-1',
      'eu-west-1',
      'eu-west-2',
      'eu-west-3',
      'sa-east-1',
    ]

Configure aws cli using aws configure --profile *profilename* command.

Export variables:

For linux:

.. code-block:: bash

    export AWS_PROFILE = profilename
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = region

For Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    set AWS_PROFILE = profilename
    set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = region

Note: the profilename should be the profile name used to configure aws cli, and region should be the aws region to bootstrap the factory.

Once you have this file you need to upload the config:

.. code-block:: bash

    servicecatalog-factory upload-config config.yaml


If you make changes to this you will need to run upload-config and bootstrap commands again for the changes to occur.

Once that has completed you are ready to bring up the rest of the factory.


Use the cli tool to create the AWS CodeCommit repo and AWS CodePipeline resources that run the factory:

.. code-block:: yaml

    servicecatalog-factory bootstrap

This command will take a little while to run.  Once the command completes you can move onto the next step.


Configuring your factory
++++++++++++++++++++++++
You now need to clone the configuration repo and configure your factory:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone \
        --config 'credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@' \
        --config 'credential.UseHttpPath=true' \
        https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/ServiceCatalogFactory
    servicecatalog-factory seed simple ServiceCatalogFactory
    cd ServiceCatalogFactory
    git add .
    git commit -am "initial add"
    git push


For Windows users, use git clone command as:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone \
        --config "credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@" \
        --config "credential.UseHttpPath=true" \
        https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/ServiceCatalogFactory


Please note ```git clone``` command above includes an AWS Region in it.  You may need to change this or you can use the
command the bootstrap command prints to the terminal upon completion for the correct command.

The seed command takes two parameters.  The first is the name of the example file you would like to use.  At the moment
here is only a _simple_ option.  You can also specify a simple github see using:

.. code-block:: bash

    servicecatalog-factory seed simple-github ServiceCatalogFactory


More will be coming soon to show the flexibility of the Factory.

Once the pipeline has completed you have a working factory!  You will now need to configure at least one product.

Setup your first product
++++++++++++++++++++++++
The simple example file you used in the previous step declared an account-iam product that is stored in CodeCommit.
For the product pipeline to work you will need to create the git repo and add the product.template.yaml.

You can use the following snippet to do this easily:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name account-iam
    git clone --config 'credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@' --config 'credential.UseHttpPath=true' https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/account-iam
    cd account-iam
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamonnfaherty/cloudformation-templates/master/iam_admin_role/product.template.yaml -o product.template.yaml
    git checkout -b v1
    git add .
    git commit -am "initial add"
    git push --set-upstream origin v1

For Windows users, use git clone command as:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --config "credential.helper=!aws codecommit credential-helper $@" --config "credential.UseHttpPath=true" https://git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/account-iam


Please note, this clone command also contains an AWS Region that may need to change for this action to work.

Once you have pushed your product.template.yaml file you and the product pipeline has completed and you have a Service 
Catalog product ready to deploy in each region of your account.
