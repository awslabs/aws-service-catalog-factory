Project Assurance
=================

Assurance
---------

This project has been through an assurance process to ensure the project is:

- valuable to AWS customers
- properly licenced


The same process ensures that there are mechanisms to ensure maintainers are:

- likely able to acceptably support it with regards to being responsive to github issues and pull requests


And finally, at the time of publishing:

- any 3rd party components actually contained in the repo are checked to ensure they are correctly licensed and that we are correctly complying with the open source licenses that apply to those 3rd party components.
