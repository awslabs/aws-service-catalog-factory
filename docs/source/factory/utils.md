Utils
=====

When building a Service Catalog factory you should expect some failures on the way.  To reduce the burden
of experimentation and to help cleaning up after your self there are the following utilities:

## nuke-product-version
You can use the ```servicecatalog-factory``` cli to remove a product from AWS Service Catalog and to remove
the AWS CodePipeline that was generated by this library.  To use it, you will need your portofolio name,
product name and product version - all of which is available to view from your AWS Service Catalog console.

Once you have the details you can run the following command:
```bash
servicecatalog-factory nuke-product-version example-simple-central-it-team-portfolio account-iam v1
```  


## delete-stack-from-all-regions
You can delete a stack from every region using the following command:
```bash
servicecatalog-factory delete-stack-from-all-regions stack-name
```
Please note, this will only delete the stack from the regions you have specifed in your config.
