# what is this?
This is a toolkit to help deliver account vending machine using aws-service-catalog-factory.

## Installing

Follow these steps (better instructions coming soon)

### Preparing the OrgAssumableRole
You need to provision the template ```org-bootstrap-template.yaml``` using CloudFormation in the 
AWS Organizations root account or you need a similar role.  If you use your own role you will 
need to set up SSM yourself.  This template creates an IAM role in the account and stores the 
ARN in an SSM Param named AssumableOrgRole.

### Preparing the Factory account
If your factory account is not your AWS Organizations root account then you will need to deploy 
the ```factory-bootstrap.template.yaml``` template into your factory account.  You will need to 
provide the output from the stack org-bootstrap-template.yaml created (AssumableOrgRoleArn) as 
the input to this template.

### Preparing the shared account creation product
You must add the ```account-creation-shared-product``` to your servicecatalog-factory portfolio:
```yaml

### Preparing the account creation product:
You must add the ```account-creation-product``` to your servicecatalog-factory portfolio:

```yaml
      - Name: account-vending-account-creation
        Owner: central-it@customer.com
        Description: template used to interact with custom resources in the shared projects
        Distributor: central-it-team

                BranchName: master
```

I have named my product ```account-vending-account-creation``` and it is coming from the repo 
```account-vending-account-creation```.

Once you have added the products to your portfolio, you must commit your portofolio and set up your product 
git repos and ensure those pipelines run correctly.

## Using the account vending machine
Log into the console and navigate to Service Catalog.  You should see a section named Provisioned products list.  
Within that section you will see a product with the name you specified - I chose ```account-vending-account-creation```

Click the product, select launch and enter your parameters, click next a few more times and you will have a bootstrapped 
account.
